# Writing Style Guide

## General Foundation

### Overview

This style guide captures the patterns, tendencies, and signature moves that define your authentic writing voice. It is designed to serve as a foundation—a reference for you or anyone writing on your behalf to produce content that sounds unmistakably like you.

The guide is based on analysis of writing samples across multiple contexts: personal reflection, instructional writing, recommendations, descriptive narrative, professional communication, opinion pieces, social posts, long-form argument, internal proposals, and customer-facing announcements.

### Core Voice Characteristics

#### Tone

Conversational by default. Your natural register is warm and approachable—you write like you're talking to someone, not lecturing them. You use direct address naturally ("you've certainly heard," "you have to start") and aren't afraid of contractions or informal phrasing.

Direct and opinionated, not aggressive. You state what you believe clearly. You don't hedge excessively or bury your point in qualifiers. But you also don't browbeat—your confidence comes from experience, not posturing.

Self-aware and nuanced. You acknowledge contradictions in your own thinking and give credit to opposing perspectives. When you make a strong point, you often temper it with a qualifier or a self-deprecating example (like advocating for critical thinking while wearing the same black t-shirt every day).

#### Register Flexibility

Your voice has a clear "professional mode" that activates when context requires it. In these situations, you dial down color and personality but retain structure and directness. Your professional writing is measured, accountable without over-apologizing, and forward-looking.

Your customer-facing writing shifts to a warmer, higher-energy register. You lead with value, use more enthusiastic language, and invite continued relationship.

You naturally calibrate length to stakes and format. Casual recommendations are short. Complex arguments get space. Compressed formats (like social posts) can go extremely brief—even five words if that's all the idea needs.

### Structural Patterns

#### The Zooming Motion

Your most consistent structural pattern is a "zooming" motion: you start broad, zoom into specific examples, zoom back out to the bigger point, then land with a close. This creates a rhythm of abstraction → concreteness → synthesis that makes your writing feel grounded and purposeful.

#### Component-Based Thinking

You naturally break experiences and arguments into distinct components. Even in descriptive writing (like the New Zealand piece), you organize around discrete memorable elements before synthesizing them. This gives your writing clarity and makes complex topics feel manageable.

#### Frameworks Over Instructions

When explaining something, you prefer to give people mental models rather than step-by-step instructions. You reach for analogies ("first principles engineering") and conceptual frames that help readers understand the why, not just the what.

#### The Contrarian Setup

In argument-driven pieces, you often set up conventional wisdom first, then systematically dismantle it. This creates a satisfying structure: here's what everyone thinks → here's the trap → here's what actually works.

### Rhetorical Signatures

#### Contrast as a Sharpening Tool

You frequently use contrast to make your points land harder. Opposites placed side by side: "rustic and luxurious," "nice but not inspiring—this place was both," "concise and clear, not perfect." This is one of your most distinctive moves.

#### Specificity as Proof

You never stay abstract for long. Claims are anchored in concrete examples: the deconstructed affogato, the WALES CODY email personalization, the Agile methodology critique. Your examples function as evidence—they show you've lived what you're talking about.

#### Punchy Closers

Your pieces frequently end with a line that could stand alone as a takeaway: "Tell more stories, get more buy in." "I would go back tomorrow." "Good strategy is painful." These closers land with a sense of finality and often carry the emotional or intellectual payload of the entire piece.

#### Shared Frustration as Bonding

In opinion pieces, you sometimes use shared frustration as a bonding device—inviting readers to roll their eyes alongside you at something absurd ("We've all seen the all caps inverted version of WALES, CODY!"). This creates camaraderie without coming across as bitter.

#### Parentheticals for Commentary

You use parentheticals and asides to add commentary without derailing the main thread. This keeps your tone conversational even when the argument is structured, and lets you inject personality into otherwise straightforward prose.

### Persuasion Style

Clarity over emotion. You persuade through clear framing and alignment, not urgency inflation or emotional appeals. Your asks are tied to outcomes the reader already cares about.

Constraints named upfront. You state costs, timelines, and requirements directly. You make it easy for someone to say yes or no by removing ambiguity.

Soft close, door open. Your persuasive writing typically ends with an invitation to continue the conversation ("happy to jump on a call") rather than a hard close. This diffuses pressure without weakening the ask.

Accountability without over-apologizing. When things go wrong, you own what happened without excessive self-flagellation. You're forward-looking and solution-oriented.

### Quick Reference

| Element | Your Style |
| --- | --- |
| Default tone | Conversational, warm, direct |
| Structure | Zoom in/out pattern, component-based, frameworks |
| Signature moves | Contrast pairs, specific examples, punchy closers |
| Length | Calibrated to stakes and format |
| Persuasion | Clarity and alignment over emotion, constraints upfront |
| Professional mode | Measured, forward-looking, reflective closers |
| Customer-facing | Warmer, higher-energy, leads with value |

### Do / Don't

#### Do

- Lead with the point, not the preamble
- Use contrast to sharpen claims
- Anchor abstractions in specific, lived examples
- End with something quotable when the format allows
- Acknowledge nuance and your own contradictions
- Give readers mental models, not just instructions
- Match length to stakes
- Name constraints and costs directly in persuasive writing

#### Don't

- Over-hedge or bury your point in qualifiers
- Stay abstract without grounding in examples
- Inflate urgency or use emotional manipulation to persuade
- Over-apologize when things go wrong
- Write more than the format or stakes require
- Lecture—write to people, not at them
- Abandon structure even when being casual

### Using This Guide

This guide is a foundation. Use it as a reference when writing something new, when editing, or when briefing someone else to write on your behalf. When in doubt, read your draft aloud and ask: does this sound like something I would actually say?

For specialized contexts (executive communications, technical documentation, specific content types), layer additional guidelines on top of this foundation.
